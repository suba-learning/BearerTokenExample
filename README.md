# 🔐 BearerTokenExample

This project demonstrates how to interact with the Stripe API using a Bearer Token for authentication in Python. It includes operations such as:

- Retrieving a list of customers
- Creating a customer
- Getting a specific customer
- Deleting a customer

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

Install the `requests` library with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Update the following variable in your script with your actual Stripe Bearer Token:

```python
b_token = "your_actual_stripe_bearer_token"
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### ✅ Retrieve Customers

This section retrieves a list of all customers from the Stripe API:

```python
response = requests.get(baseurl, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

---

### 🆕 Create a Customer

This section creates a new customer with the provided details:

```python
payload = "email=test2%40test.com&name=TestPython2&next_invoice_sequence=3"
response = requests.post(baseurl, headers=post_headers, data=payload)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json()["id"])
new_customer_id = response.json()["id"]
```

---

### 🔍 Get a Customer

Retrieve the details of a specific customer using their customer ID:

```python
customer_id = new_customer_id
response = requests.get(baseurl + "/" + customer_id, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

---

### ❌ Delete a Customer

Delete a customer by customer ID:

```python
response = requests.delete(baseurl + "/" + customer_id, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)
```

---

### ❓ Delete a Non-Existing Customer

Attempt to delete a non-existing customer and handle the 404 response:

```python
customer_id = "cus_RqDFQyyJ5sglwc"
response = requests.delete(baseurl + "/" + customer_id, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 404:
    print("Customer not found")
```
